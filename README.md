This is a ongoing project from udacity android course. Application uses TheMovieDb web site to access its api and downloads 
most popular and top rated movies and shows them in the Main Activity. Also, settings activity holds radio button to switch from 
most popular to top rated movies. Detail page is implemented, but it only shows image link nothing else. This is on going project
and its not been finished yet. Screen captures of the finished pages can be founded in Wiki.
In order to run the application on actual device, user have to register at https://www.themoviedb.org/ and acquire api key which should then be inserted in build.gradle file.
